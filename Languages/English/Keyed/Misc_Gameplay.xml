	<VCR.AAtooltip>Armor effectiveness is doubled and armor penetration of weapons is quadrupled\n\nThis means that 100% armor will block any attacks with no armor penetration, the equivalent of wearing 200% armor protection in vanilla.\nArmor penetration of weapons has been effectively doubled relative to the displayed armor values\n\nExample:\n50% armor penetration bullet against 200% sharp protection armor\nVanilla: armor is reduced to 150%, damage is halved 25% of the time, blocked 75% of the time.\nAdvanced Armor: armor is reduced to 100%, damage is blocked 100% of the time.</VCR.AAtooltip>

	<VCR.AccScaleTooltip>Minimum accuracy before advanced accuracy calculations are activated, inversely related to accuracy per point\n\nWith a higher threshold, each point above the threshold has a smaller effect than with a lower threshold\n\nRecommended accuracy: 5</VCR.AccScaleTooltip>

	<VCR.BulletsWorker>Custom Bullet Damage Worker</VCR.BulletsWorker>
	<VCR.BWorkerTooltip>Bullets now have simulated fragmentation, pass through, and mushrooming damage behaviors based on the stopping power of the weapon, multiple projectiles on the same weapon will use the stopping power value of the first projectile.</VCR.BWorkerTooltip>
